# Use this to define default descriptions for column across all models
# The `dbt-superset` tool will read, and apply the descriptions to
# dbt generated docs + superset datasets.
#
# This enables standardization, prevents duplication, and reduces effort.
#
# Descriptions can still be defined in dbt `schema.yml` file, which will
# override the defaults here, and allows for customization where needed.
